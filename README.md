# [Manage your useless GitHub forks](https://caub.github.io/github-clean-forks)

## Usage
You'll need a [GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) to use this tool. You can manage your GitHub tokens at https://github.com/settings/tokens. Make sure the token has the `user:email` permission for listing the repositories, and the `delete_repo` permission if you also wish to delete forks directly from the tool's interface.
